1) what is git hub?

consider GitHub as a web interface for using Git. GitLab, Gogs, etc. are the other websites providing the same services as GitHub, but GitLab has been gaining much popularity after Microsoftâ€™s recent acquisition of GitHub.

I would say these websites are just like social networking sites, but for programmers and/or developers where they can show-off their skills, projects, contributions, etc. Before understanding GitHub, one must understand Version Control System and Git

program to add one number:

#include <stdio.h>
int input (void)
{
   int a;
   printf ("Enter a number \n");
   scanf ("%d", &a);
   return a:
}
int compute (int x)
{
   x=x+1;
   return x;
}
void output (int m, int n)
{
   printf ("%d+1 is %d", m,n);
}
int main (void)
{
   int a=input();
   int b=compute(a);
   output (a,b);
}
