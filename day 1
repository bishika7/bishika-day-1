LEARNING EPISODE 1

1) what is #include <stdio.h>?
   is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the preprocessor before the program is compiled. Line 3 tells the preprocessor to include the contents
of the standard input/output header (<stdio.h>) in the program. This header contains
information used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library
functions such as printf. (pg no.25)
